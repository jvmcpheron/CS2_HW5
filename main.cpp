No test issues reported



One thing that surprised me was how much the speed varied by each of our machines, 
but it made sense. It just wasn't something I was thinking about. For my own results 
for the binary search, the binary search became much faster as the size grew. Yassine's
results for the binary search look quite similar. I was very surprised at the extent of the
difference, but the other thing I thought was interesting was that the 1000 list took substantially
longer than the 9000 list. I don't fully understand why this happened, but it is very interesting.

For the testing of MyBag, I just added chrono to the functions. I learned a bit about chrono
and about what a unit test actually does. These tests went really fast too, but they were all
done with a very small amount of data, so it's not very surprising. The thing this part of the assignmnet
taught me the most about was header files and how they work witht he code. I know I am probably
not using them right yet, but I am happy I got it working. 


PLEASE NOTE THAT THE CPP FILE I TURN IN DOES NOT INCLUDE THE HEADER FILE THAT THIS
CPP FILE NEEDS TO WORK. I AM NOT SURE HOW YOU WANT USE TO COMBINE THESE FILES
